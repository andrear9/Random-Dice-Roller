# Dice Game

This code creates a simple dice roller in JavaScript. The program generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, representing the outcome of rolling two dice. Then, the game changes the images of the two dice to match the randomly generated numbers. Finally, the game compares the two randomly generated numbers and determines a winner.

## How it works

1. The code generates two random numbers between 1 and 6.
2. The code changes the images of the two dice to match the randomly generated numbers.
3. The code compares the two randomly generated numbers and determines a winner.
4. If there is a winner, the code displays a message saying that the winner is Player 1 or Player 2.
5. If there is no winner, the code displays a message saying that the game is a tie.
